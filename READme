ASCII Music Visualizer
A Python-based music visualization tool that converts audio files into colorful, real-time ASCII art visualizations. Watch your music come to life through dynamic character patterns and colors that respond to the audio frequencies!
Features

Real-time audio visualization using ASCII characters
Color-coded intensity mapping
Support for MP3 and WAV audio files
Dynamic frequency spectrum analysis
Customizable frame rate
Multi-color output using terminal colors
Smooth real-time rendering

Prerequisites
Before running the visualizer, make sure you have Python installed. You'll  need the following packages:
bashCopypip install numpy librosa colorama
Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code
Install the required dependencies:

bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

Run the script:

bashCopypython music_visualizer.py

When prompted, enter the path to your audio file
Watch the visualization!
Press Ctrl+C to stop the visualization

How It Works
The visualizer works by:

Loading and analyzing the audio file using librosa
Converting the audio into a mel spectrogram
Normalizing the frequency data
Mapping frequencies to ASCII characters and colors
Displaying the visualization in real-time

Visualization Legend

Characters represent intensity (from lowest to highest):

" " (space): silence
"." : very low intensity
":" : low intensity
"+" : medium intensity
"X" : high intensity
"@" : peak intensity


Colors represent intensity ranges:

Blue: Low intensity
Green: Medium intensity
Yellow: High intensity
Red: Peak intensity




fps: Change the frame rate (default: 24)
characters: Modify the ASCII characters used
Color schemes can be adjusted in the get_color method
